        <Summary>Sayonara is a small, clear and fast audio player for Linux</Summary>
        <Description>Sayonara is a small, clear and fast audio player for Linux written in C++, supported by the Qt framework. It uses Gstreamer as audio backend.

Although Sayoanra is considered as a lightweight player, it holds a lot of features to organize even big music collections.

Most of them are known from the bigger and well known ausdio players but the main focus during developing (in contrast to many other players) has been performance, low CPU usage and low memory consumption.

One of Sayonara's goals are intuitive and easy usablility never leading to the impression you are using an unnecessary bloated program. Currently it is only available for Linux.</Description>
