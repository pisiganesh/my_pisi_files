        <Summary>This is Viewnior, an image viewer program</Summary>
        <Description>This is Viewnior, an image viewer program. Created to be simple, fast and elegant. It's minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for your images. Among its features are:

    Fullscreen &amp; Slideshow
    Rotate, flip, crop, save, delete images
    Animation support
    Browse only selected images
    Navigation window
    Set image as wallpaper (GNOME2, GNOME3, XFCE, LXDE, FluxBox)
    Simple interface
    Configurable mouse actions

Viewnior is insipred by big projects like Eye of Gnome, because of it's usability and richness,and by GPicView, because of it's lightweight design and minimal interface. So here comes Viewnior - small and light, with no compromise with the quality of it's functions. The program is made with better integration in mind (follows Gnome HIG2)

Viewnior is written in C (GTK+) and uses modified version of the GtkImageView library by Bjourn Lindqvist. Without it, image viewing wouldn't be such a pleasure. :)
